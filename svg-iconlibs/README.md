# What is icon lib?
We provide some material design icons in this library. The library contains java render classes and
vector resources generated by svg-generator. Also, you can get those icons from 'New->Vector Asset',
but I don't think it is a easy way.

# Where these icons from?

https://github.com/google/material-design-icons

# How i use icons

- Open file 'icons.html' with Chrome.
